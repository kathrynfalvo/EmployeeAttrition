# Employee Performance & Attrition

In this project for our Machine Learning class, we selected a dataset from Kaggle of collected empployee data relating to each individual's position, length of time at the company, performance, salary, attrition, work-life balance, and so on.
Our objective was to provide insights to human resource departments to attempt to reduce turnover. Using Python, we identified what the most impactful components for employees are, providing insight on what may keep them at a company for a longer period of time.
